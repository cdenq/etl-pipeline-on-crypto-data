## About ETL Pipeline on Crypto Data

`ETL Pipeline on Crypto Data` is a team-based Python data analytics project done on daily crypto data for 9 coins. It:
1) extracts raw data in three different ways: direct file reading with pandas (.csv), api requests (.json), and web scraping (.html)
2) transforms that data into aggregates by month (average, max, min, average growth)
3) loads that data into a final .sql database

Along with the analysis, project also involved a written report.
